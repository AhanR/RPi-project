# RPi-project
Creating a garden watering system based on humidity levels

# Run the same simulator
Go to <a href="https://trinket.io/sense-hat" >sense hat</a> and paste in the code then run it. Play with the humidity slider to see it in action.

# Explanation
The simulator provides the humidity values through it's sense hat library and we are using it to read and display the humidity by lighting up the corresponding number of LEDs. When the LED is green, the plant does not need water, if the LED is red, the plant needs water. In this code we have set the trigger point at 50% but that can ewasily be changed
